# code
This a collection of useful Perl and Python code I've written over the years.

# Perl
Includes some of my better contributions on [perlmonks](https://www.perlmonks.org/).  My user name over there was [perldoc](https://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=85131).

Also includes the article I wrote for The Perl Journal, "Recursive Traversal of an FTP Site", (which subsequently became a chapter in the O'Reilly book [Computer Science & Perl Programming - The Best Of The Perl Journal](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596003104.do)).

# Python
Includes my Python Power Tools collection of Unix work-alike commands, implemented in pure Python.
