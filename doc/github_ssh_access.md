# SSH Setup

Do this to create your SSH Key before you can access
your repositories.  Otherwise you will get `Permission denied (publickey)`
error message when you try to `git push`.


Create a new `ssh-rsa` key:
```
> cd ~/.ssh
> ls -la
> ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "gerard@lanois.com"
> eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
> ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
> cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Copy it to your clipboard:
```
# Linux
> xclip -selection clipboard < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
# MacOS X
> pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Go to your GitHub account->Settings->SSH and GPG Keys->SSH Keys, click the `New SSH key` button, and paste into the `Key` field.

Test the new key:
```
> ssh -T git@github.com
```

# Converting Existing http-based Clone To Use SSH

If you cloned originally using an HTTP URL you are going to have to convert it over use your username before you cane use command-line SSH authentication for `push` and other such Git commands.

See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23546865/how-to-configure-command-line-git-to-use-ssh-key

See accepted answer:

Assuming that you have used ssh-keygen to generate a key pair and uploaded the public key in the appropriate place in your github account, you should be able to set remote to use the url `git@github.com:username/repo.git`.

```
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repo.git
```

If you do not have local changes that you care about, you can just delete your local repository and clone again:

```
git clone git@github.com:username/repo.git
```
